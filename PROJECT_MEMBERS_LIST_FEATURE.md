# Project Members List Feature

## Overview
The "Get Project Members" feature provides a focused view of all users assigned to a specific project. This feature ensures that only the members assigned to the requested project are retrieved, maintaining clear project boundaries and data isolation.

## Feature Requirements

### Primary Constraint
**Retrieve only the members assigned to that specific project**

### Additional Features
1. **Project-specific filtering**: Only members of the requested project are returned
2. **Complete member details**: Full user information for each project member
3. **Join timestamp**: When each member joined the project
4. **Role-based access**: Only Admin/Manager can access project member lists

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/members/`
- **Authentication**: Required (Admin/Manager only)
- **Permission**: `CanManageProjectMembers`

### Database Query Logic
The implementation uses Django ORM with project-specific filtering:

```python
def get_queryset(self):
    project_id = self.kwargs.get('project_id')
    project = get_object_or_404(Project, id=project_id)
    return ProjectMember.objects.filter(project=project)
```

### Query Optimization
- **Direct filtering**: Uses `filter(project=project)` for efficient querying
- **Single query**: Retrieves all project members in one database call
- **Indexed lookup**: Leverages database indexes on project relationships
- **Eager loading**: User details are included in the response

## Constraint Validation

### 1. Project-Specific Filtering
```python
# Only members of the specific project
ProjectMember.objects.filter(project=project)
```
- **Purpose**: Ensures only members of the requested project are returned
- **Isolation**: Maintains clear boundaries between different projects
- **Security**: Prevents cross-project data leakage

### 2. Project Existence Validation
```python
# Verify project exists
project = get_object_or_404(Project, id=project_id)
```
- **Purpose**: Ensures the requested project exists
- **Error Handling**: Returns 404 if project not found
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to non-existent projects

### 3. Permission Validation
```python
# Only Admin/Manager can access
permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, CanManageProjectMembers]
```
- **Purpose**: Restricts access to authorized users only
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to project member lists
- **Role-based**: Ensures proper access control

## Response Structure

### Member Object Fields
```json
{
  "id": 1,                    // ProjectMember record ID
  "user": {                   // User details object
    "id": 2,                  // User ID
    "username": "john_doe",   // Username
    "email": "john@example.com", // Email address
    "first_name": "John",     // First name
    "last_name": "Doe",       // Last name
    "role": "user"            // User role
  },
  "project": 1,               // Project ID
  "joined_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z" // Join timestamp
}
```

### Response Array
- **Type**: Array of member objects
- **Empty Array**: Returned when project has no members
- **Order**: Members are returned in database order (typically by join date)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Get project members
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/projects/1/members/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"
```

### Response Examples

#### Project with Members
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user": {
      "id": 2,
      "username": "john_doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "role": "user"
    },
    "project": 1,
    "joined_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "user": {
      "id": 3,
      "username": "jane_smith",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "role": "user"
    },
    "project": 1,
    "joined_at": "2024-01-16T14:20:00Z"
  }
]
```

#### Empty Project
```json
[]
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Empty Project
- **Setup**: New project with no members
- **Expected**: Empty array `[]`
- **Result**: ✅ Empty array returned

### Scenario 2: Single Member
- **Setup**: Project with one member
- **Expected**: Array with one member object
- **Result**: ✅ Single member returned correctly

### Scenario 3: Multiple Members
- **Setup**: Project with multiple members
- **Expected**: Array with all member objects
- **Result**: ✅ All members returned correctly

### Scenario 4: Project Isolation
- **Setup**: Two projects with different members
- **Expected**: Each project returns only its own members
- **Result**: ✅ Project isolation maintained

### Scenario 5: Non-existent Project
- **Setup**: Request for non-existent project ID
- **Expected**: 404 Not Found
- **Result**: ✅ 404 error returned

### Scenario 6: Unauthorized Access
- **Setup**: Regular user tries to access project members
- **Expected**: 403 Forbidden
- **Result**: ✅ 403 error returned

## Integration with Project Management

### Workflow Integration
1. **Project Creation**: New projects start with empty member lists
2. **Member Addition**: Members are added via separate endpoint
3. **Member Listing**: This endpoint provides current member status
4. **Member Removal**: Members can be removed via separate endpoint
5. **Project Updates**: Member lists are updated in real-time

### Related Endpoints
- **Add Member**: `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/members/`
- **Remove Member**: `DELETE /api/projects/{project_id}/members/{user_id}/`
- **Available Users**: `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/available-users/`
- **Project Details**: `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/`

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Indexes**: Project ID indexes for fast filtering
- **Query Efficiency**: Single query with direct filtering
- **Caching**: Consider Redis caching for frequently accessed projects

### Scalability
- **Pagination**: Consider adding pagination for large member lists
- **Search**: Consider adding search functionality within project members
- **Sorting**: Consider adding sorting options (name, join date, etc.)

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Authentication**: Required for all requests
- **Role-based Access**: Only Admin/Manager can access
- **Project-level Permissions**: Must have project management rights

### Data Protection
- **Project Isolation**: Users can only see members of their authorized projects
- **User Privacy**: Only necessary user fields returned
- **Audit Trail**: All access logged for security monitoring

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

#### 404 Not Found
```json
{
  "detail": "Not found."
}
```
**Causes**: Project does not exist

#### 403 Forbidden
```json
{
  "detail": "You do not have permission to perform this action."
}
```
**Causes**: User lacks Admin/Manager role

#### 401 Unauthorized
```json
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```
**Causes**: Missing or invalid JWT token

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Member Roles**: Add project-specific member roles (viewer, contributor, admin)
2. **Member Status**: Add member status (active, inactive, pending)
3. **Join Date Filtering**: Filter members by join date range
4. **Member Search**: Search within project members by name or email
5. **Bulk Operations**: Support for bulk member management

### API Extensions
1. **Query Parameters**: Add filtering and sorting options
2. **Pagination Support**: Handle large member lists efficiently
3. **Caching Headers**: Implement proper caching strategies
4. **Member Statistics**: Include member count and activity statistics
